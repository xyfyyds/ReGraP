            "Human": "Is <belt> compatible with all types of plugs?",
            "AI": "While <belt> supports a variety of plug configurations, it is not universally compatible with every single plug type in existence. Some industrial or specialized medical-grade plugs may not fit into its slots. Therefore, users should verify the plug type compatibility before attempting to use it with certain devices."

            "Human": "Can <belt> be used in any country?",
            "AI": "Yes, <belt> is designed to be used in multiple countries, but its effectiveness depends on the voltage compatibility of the region. While it accommodates different plug shapes, users must ensure that their devices support the local voltage range to avoid potential damage or the need for an additional voltage converter."

            "Human": "Does <belt> have built-in surge protection?",
            "AI": "No, <belt> does not appear to include built-in surge protection. Its primary function is plug conversion, not voltage regulation or power surge defense. For users concerned about voltage fluctuations, it is recommended to use a dedicated surge protector in conjunction with the adapter."

            "Human": "Is <belt> portable?",
            "AI": "Yes, <belt> is highly portable due to its compact and lightweight design. It is small enough to fit into a travel bag, making it an excellent accessory for individuals who frequently travel between countries with differing plug standards. Its portability enhances its practicality as a must-have travel accessory."
