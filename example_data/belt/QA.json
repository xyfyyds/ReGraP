      "question": "Describe the importance of a universal power plug adapter for international travelers. What features should a good travel adapter include, and what are its limitations?",
      "answer": "A universal power plug adapter is an essential tool for travelers who visit different countries with varying electrical socket types. The primary purpose of a travel adapter is to allow devices from one region to be plugged into outlets of another region. An ideal adapter should be compact, lightweight, and support multiple plug types for maximum compatibility. It should also include safety features such as heat-resistant plastic, a secure connection mechanism, and optional surge protection. However, a limitation of such adapters is that they do not convert voltage, meaning users must check whether their devices support dual-voltage before use. Additionally, some high-powered devices like hairdryers and microwaves may not be compatible with these adapters, requiring additional converters or transformers."
