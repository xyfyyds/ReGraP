        {
            "Human": "What is the primary function of <cd_driver>?",
            "AI": "The primary function of the device is to act as an external CD/DVD reader and writer. It allows users to read data from optical discs, install software from CDs, watch DVDs, and burn data onto writable discs. This functionality is especially useful for modern laptops that lack built-in optical drives."

        {
            "Human": "What is the design style of <cd_driver>?",
            "AI": "The device features a minimalist and modern design, with a smooth metallic finish and a clean, logo-centered aesthetic. The brushed aluminum surface reduces fingerprints and scratches, while the compact form factor ensures practicality."
        },
        {
            "Human": "Does <cd_driver> require additional drivers to function?",
            "AI": "Most modern external drives are plug-and-play, meaning they do not require additional drivers for basic functionality. However, for advanced features like DVD burning, specific software applications may be needed. Therefore, while the device is largely driver-free, additional software might be required for specialized tasks."
        },
        {
            "Human": "Is <cd_driver> compatible with all computers?",
            "AI": "The device uses USB-A connectors, meaning it is compatible with most desktop and laptop computers. However, some newer laptops that only have USB-C ports may require an adapter. Compatibility with different operating systems is also expected, as most external drives are designed to work with Windows, macOS, and Linux."

        {
            "Human": "What is the design style of <cd_driver>?",
            "AI": "The device features a minimalist and modern design, with a smooth metallic finish and a clean, logo-centered aesthetic. The brushed aluminum surface reduces fingerprints and scratches, while the compact form factor ensures practicality."
        },
        {
            "Human": "Does <cd_driver> require additional drivers to function?",
            "AI": "Most modern external drives are plug-and-play, meaning they do not require additional drivers for basic functionality. However, for advanced features like DVD burning, specific software applications may be needed. Therefore, while the device is largely driver-free, additional software might be required for specialized tasks."
        },
        {
            "Human": "Is <cd_driver> compatible with all computers?",
            "AI": "The device uses USB-A connectors, meaning it is compatible with most desktop and laptop computers. However, some newer laptops that only have USB-C ports may require an adapter. Compatibility with different operating systems is also expected, as most external drives are designed to work with Windows, macOS, and Linux."
