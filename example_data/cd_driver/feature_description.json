            "Human": "What is the material of <cd_driver>?",
            "AI": "The external surface appears to be made of metal, likely aluminum or a brushed metallic composite, providing durability while keeping it lightweight. The disc tray and interior components, however, are made of plastic, which is standard for reducing weight and production costs. The combination of metal for the casing and plastic for internal mechanisms balances durability and functionality. Thus, the material of <cd_driver> is a mix of metal and plastic."
